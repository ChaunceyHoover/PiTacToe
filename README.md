PiTacToe
========

**PiTacToe** is a simple TicTacToe written in C using the SDL multi-media library. It was created as a school project and is available to anyone.

About
---------
The game uses only keyboard input, as it was easiest and the preferred input of author. The only possible future update will be adding in audio and fixing any bugs. 

Controls
-----------
Use the arrow keys to move your piece and press enter to place the piece. Alternatively, if available, the keypad can be used. Press the key once to move the piece to a spot, and again to place it on that set spot.

Compilation
------------
The game was made on an ARMv6 build of Arch Linux, so simplying running `make` from the command line will handle everything. For just compilation and no execution, run `make build`.
